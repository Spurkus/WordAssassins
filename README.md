# 🥷Word Assassins 🔪

Each player is assigned a target and a “kill word” for that target. Your mission? Get your target to say their trigger word naturally in conversation, eliminating them from the game. Once successful, you'll inherit their target and kill word, moving closer to being the last player standing. But be careful—someone else is after you too!

Stay alert, think fast, and outsmart everyone to win!
